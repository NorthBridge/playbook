**2015 End Goal**

Alliance serves as the system of record for all Northbridge project work--our organizational backlog. Alliance will serve all project development activity performed by volunteers, interns and staff.

**Longer Term Goals**

Alliance serves as the entry-point for the suite of back-end collaboration tools that Northbridge has already developed and piloted within Nexus.

Explore potential for Alliance to have life as a broader-serving open source tool.
